# gw2skirmish

Website that displays WvW Skirmish information from Guild Wars 2.

## Features

This is not yet another way to display current WvW Matches information. The aim is to provide unique features not found on other websites.

### Homestretch

Ever wondered if the opponent already won or if you can still make it? Or if you could AFK and still win the match? The homestretch indicates how far you are from securing your position from the opponent.

Feature of v1.0

### Objective Advisor

Useful for commanders, this tool will analyze the current situation of a match and will advise on which color team to focus on to maximize your winning chances.

Example: if your team is second in Victory Points but first on War Score, the recommendation will be to push the opponent which is first in VP to be last in score and get +2 VP difference over them instead of 1.

Feature of v2.0

### Objective History

This tool imitates a Video Player of the Map screen, so that you can rewind back to what happened while you were sleeping.

Feature of v3.0

## Usage

`make_html.sh` will create `index.html`
